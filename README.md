# SPACE_WEATHER_FORECSTING_ML_MODEL

Space weather refers to the environmental conditions in space influenced by solar winds and other forms of solar activity. Accurate space weather forecasting is essential for mitigating the impact of solar storms on Earth-based and satellite technologies.In this project, we developed a machine learning model capable of predicting space weather events using historical solar data. The goal was to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasting by leveraging various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.
